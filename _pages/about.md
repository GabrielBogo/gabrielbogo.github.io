title: About me

---

I experimented with different industries and functions over the last 5 years: engineering, business consulting, a tech startup, a government position and a Master's degree. While some would consider frequent career changes as indicative of indecisiveness, I would claim they constitute deliberate experimentation and solid strategy for early career professionals. In fact, there was absolutely no way I could have foreseen - and planned accordingly - where I would be today when I first started working in the real world. So let me tell you a little bit about how I ended up here.

In 2016, after two years of working as a Strategy Consultant, the experience with general management gave me enough confidence to quit my job and start my own business with a web app in the Tourism industry. Since none of the co-founders had any knowledge of web programming, and our initial attempt at outsourcing the development of the platform was utterly frustrating, we decided to become developers ourselves. In seven months of full-time dedication, I taught myself the basics of Linux, Python, Django, Git, DevOps, Algorithms, Data Structures, Networks and Databases, which rendered the team technically self-sufficient and enabled us to iterate the product rapidly and adapt it to new customer discoveries. A few months later, we had built an outstanding online platform that eventually sparked the commercial interest of one of the country’s largest tour operators.  

After a journey of fourteen months we concluded that our business model was unsound and decided to shut down the startup. However, the experience of being in the intersection of software engineering and business development was extraordinary and aroused my interest in the growing field of Data Science, where I could combine this newly identified vocation with my quantitative background in engineering and experience in business. Again, I entered an immersive full-time period to teach myself Python’s scientific stack, Statistics, Probability and Machine Learning and, after one month, I was offered my current job as a Data Scientist in the Smart Cities division of the municipality of Joinville, the third largest city in the south of Brazil.

It didn't take me long to realize that I was tapping into a field of enormous potential and that I needed to bring my skills up to another level of expertise - hence my decision to seek my Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia.

It is exciting to be on the brink of a revolution and I am looking forward to discovering what great products I'll be helping to build in the years to come.
