This is the Part II of a series of three posts. Check out [Part I](/waze1) if you haven't done so yet or skip directly to [Part III](/waze3).

To be published soon.

As explained in [Part I](/waze1) of this article series, Waze provides a data stream that is updated every one minute. It's basically a JSON file containing relevant information about local traffic which, in a nutshell, is comprised of the following features:

* datetime
* jam id
* jam length
* jam speed
* jam delay (delay caused to the driver when compared to free flow)
* coordinates vector (a list of cordinates indicating the geographical position of the jam line)

In summary, for every single jam line that exists in the city for that particular moment, we could get the above information. And that is updated every minute.

That begs the question: what's the best way to capture and store this data, so it can be retrieved for analysis in a future moment?

Well, before we get into a plethora of data engineering terms, we must lay down a few restrictions we had by being a government division with very restricted budget:

1. We could not rely on any major cloud solution (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). Due to slow bureaucracy, it would take to long for the purchase to be accepted by the authorities;
2. The data could not be analyzed locally. The available computer infrastructure was insufficient even for the simplest analysis.
3. Price and simplicity had to precede performance. Due to lack of specialized skills in our department, the maintainability of the system was far more important than its sophistication.

After months of subsequent experimentation, the architecture was the following: -->
