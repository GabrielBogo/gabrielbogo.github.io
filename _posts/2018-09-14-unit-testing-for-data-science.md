# Unit Testing for Data Science
#### by Gabriel Bogo  <br><br>

You finally finished the project.  

After two weeks of cleaning and wrangling data, adjusting for missing values, dealing with outliers, understanding patterns and behaviors and creating visualizations, you are finally with your submission-ready Jupyter notebook, that runs based on nearly 1000 extra lines of code contained in packages and modules written by yourself and your other four teammates. The conclusions are surprising! Apparently, 20% of the product portfolio of the client company is actually value-destroying and should be immediately discontinued. Supply chain is also poorly managed and around 40% of your suppliers are being overpaid - the procurement director is doing a horrible job and must be replaced. Furthermore, administrative overhead is just killing the company's productivity - an unavoidable large scale lay-off is necessary if the company intends to maintain its operation for the long term.

You feel proud of yourself and privileged to have contributed towards this joint effort with your colleagues. It is now time to present the results to the client, go home and rest. One day before the presentation, however, your manager shows up skeptical with these results: "This does not make sense!"

Are you really confident with your analysis? How can you be so sure?

Stay tuned - we will talk about Unit Testing for Data Science shortly.
